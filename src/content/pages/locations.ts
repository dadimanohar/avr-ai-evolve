      question: "Can you work with clients in other time zones?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We schedule calls in your local time and maintain overlap hours for US, UK, UAE and European clients. Day-to-day communication runs on email, WhatsApp and a shared task board.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you charge more for international clients?",
      answer:
        "No premium for geography. Pricing reflects scope and competition, which is why international clients often find our rates 50–70% below local agency quotes for the same deliverables.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle multi-country SEO?",
      answer:
        "With a proper hreflang and URL architecture, native-language content, localised currency and spelling, and country-specific entity signals so each market resolves correctly in search and AI systems.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer local SEO for multiple branches?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Each branch gets its own optimised location page, Google Business Profile management, consistent citations and review generation, all tracked separately in reporting.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you target a city where you have no office?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Ranking in a city requires locally relevant content, citations and reviews, not a physical office — though a genuine local address is required to appear in the map pack itself.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which markets give the fastest ROI?",
      answer:
        "Lower-competition Indian metros such as Visakhapatnam, Kolkata and Pune usually move fastest. In international markets, long-tail and AI-citation strategies deliver returns well before head-term rankings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you optimise for local AI search?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Local AEO includes LocalBusiness schema with geo-coordinates, consistent NAP everywhere, and answer-first locality content so AI assistants recommend you for 'near me' style prompts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get a quote for my location?",
      answer:
        "Request a free audit through the contact page. You will receive a market-specific roadmap, timeline and price quoted in your currency within three working days.",
    },

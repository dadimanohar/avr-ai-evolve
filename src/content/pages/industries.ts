    },
    {
      question: `How long does ${s.name.toLowerCase()} SEO take to show results?`,
      answer: `Technical and on-page fixes usually move impressions within 3–6 weeks. Meaningful ranking and enquiry growth typically lands in months 3–6, with compounding gains after that. Sites with existing authority move faster than new domains.`,
    },
    {
      question: `What does ${s.name.toLowerCase()} SEO cost at AVR Web Consulting?`,
      answer: `Programmes start at $100/month for focused local or single-service work and scale with content volume, number of locations and competition. We quote after a free audit so the scope matches the opportunity, not a template.`,
    },
    {
      question: `Which keywords matter most for ${s.name.toLowerCase()}?`,

    },
    {
      question: `Do you also handle paid ads for ${s.name.toLowerCase()} clients?`,
      answer: `Yes. Google Ads and social advertising run alongside SEO so you have demand today while organic and AI visibility compound. Many clients start with paid for speed and shift budget to organic as rankings mature.`,
    },
    {
      question: `Which KPIs do you report for ${s.name.toLowerCase()}?`,

    },
    {
      question: `Is the work manual and safe for ${s.name.toLowerCase()} sites?`,

    },
    {
      question: `Can you work with our existing ${s.name.toLowerCase()} website?`,

    {
      question: "Does industry experience actually matter in SEO?",
      answer:
        "Yes — mostly for speed and accuracy. Knowing the intent clusters, compliance limits and schema types for a sector removes months of discovery and avoids strategies that cannot be published in regulated industries.",

      question: "Do you work with competitors in the same city?",

      question: "What does an industry programme cost?",
      answer:
        "From $100/month for a focused local or single-service scope, scaling with content volume, locations and competitiveness. Every quote follows a free audit so the scope matches the opportunity.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly do industry programmes show results?",
      answer:
        "Impressions typically move in 3–6 weeks after technical fixes. Rankings and enquiry growth generally become material in months 3–6, with authority-driven compounding after that.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide content writing for regulated industries?",

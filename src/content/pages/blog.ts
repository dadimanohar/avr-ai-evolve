      { question: "What should I do myself to save money?", answer: "Collect reviews, supply photos, answer our subject-matter questions and publish updates. Those cost you time and save agency hours." },
      { question: "When will I see leads?", answer: "Local businesses commonly see the first additional calls within 6-10 weeks, mostly from Business Profile and map-pack improvements." },
      { question: "Should I buy backlinks with a small budget?", answer: "No. At this budget, cheap links are the fastest way to waste money and risk penalties. Reviews and citations return more." },
      { question: "Can I pause and resume later?", answer: "You can, and rankings usually hold for a while, but competitors keep publishing — restarting after long gaps costs more than staying consistent." },

    answer:
      "To redesign without losing rankings, inventory every existing URL and its traffic, keep URLs identical wherever possible, map 1:1 redirects for the rest, preserve title tags, headings, content depth and schema, launch in a staged window, then monitor Search Console and rankings daily for six weeks.",

      { question: "Will a redesign always drop my rankings?", answer: "No. A well-executed migration usually sees a brief fluctuation and then recovery, often above the previous baseline if speed and content improve." },

      { question: "How long should redirects stay in place?", answer: "Permanently where possible, and at minimum one year. Old links keep sending traffic long after the change." },

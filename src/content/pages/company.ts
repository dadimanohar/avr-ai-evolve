    { question: "Is there a minimum contract?", answer: "No. Every plan is month-to-month. We ask for a fair 3-month view because SEO compounds, but you can cancel any month with 15 days' notice." },
    { question: "Why is AVR cheaper than most agencies?", answer: "We run a lean, senior team from Visakhapatnam, India, with no expensive sales layer. You pay for execution hours, not offices and account managers." },
    { question: "Does cheap SEO mean low quality?", answer: "No. Our low prices come from cost of location, not shortcuts. All work is manual and white-hat — no PBNs, no automated links, no scraped content." },
    { question: "What does the AI SEO add-on include?", answer: "Answer-first content rewrites, entity and schema work, llms.txt and crawler access setup, plus monthly tracking of how often ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and Google AI Overviews cite your brand." },

    { question: "How do you bill international clients?", answer: "US, UK, UAE and EU clients are billed in USD via bank transfer, Wise or card. Indian clients are billed in INR with GST invoices." },
    { question: "Can I buy a one-off audit instead of a monthly plan?", answer: "Yes. A full technical, on-page and AI visibility audit is $120 as a standalone deliverable, and that fee is credited if you start a monthly plan within 30 days." },
    { question: "What results should I expect for the price?", answer: "Typically measurable technical and on-page gains in 30 days, first ranking movement in 60-90 days, and compounding traffic growth from month 4. Competitive national terms take longer." },
    { question: "Do prices include ad spend?", answer: "No. Management fees are separate from ad budget, which you pay directly to Google or Meta so you keep full ownership of the ad accounts." },

    { question: "How much does a website cost?", answer: "Small business sites start around $400, content-rich multi-service sites typically run $800–$2,000, and e-commerce builds depend on catalogue size and integrations. Every quote is fixed-scope with the deliverables written down before work begins." },
    { question: "How long does a website take to build?", answer: "A focused business site takes three to four weeks, larger content sites four to six, and e-commerce five to seven. The main variable is content readiness — projects where copy and images are ready launch weeks sooner." },
    { question: "Will my new site keep its existing rankings?", answer: "Yes, when the migration is done properly. We map every existing URL to its new destination with 301 redirects, preserve title and heading structure on ranking pages, and monitor indexation daily for the first fortnight after launch." },
    { question: "Do you design mobile-first?", answer: "Always. Most traffic in our clients' markets is mobile, and Google indexes the mobile version. Designs are drawn at mobile widths first and expanded upward, rather than shrinking a desktop layout." },
    { question: "Can I edit the website myself?", answer: "Yes. WordPress and Shopify builds come with a page builder or block setup plus a short recorded walkthrough, so your team can update text, images, blog posts and products without needing us." },
    { question: "Do you provide hosting?", answer: "We advise on hosting and can set it up in your own account, so you always own the infrastructure and billing. For most business sites we recommend managed hosting with a CDN rather than the cheapest shared plan." },
    { question: "Is the site optimised for AI search?", answer: "Yes. Templates include answer-first content blocks, FAQ sections with schema, clean semantic markup and an llms.txt file, all of which make the site easier for AI retrieval systems to parse and cite." },
    { question: "What about website speed?", answer: "We set performance budgets during the build and test on throttled mobile connections. Targets are green Core Web Vitals: LCP under 2.5 seconds, INP under 200ms and CLS under 0.1 on real devices, not just on a fast desktop." },
    { question: "Do you offer maintenance after launch?", answer: "Thirty days of support is included with every build. After that, optional maintenance covers updates, backups, security monitoring, uptime checks and a monthly content or design change allowance." },
    { question: "Can you redesign an existing site?", answer: "Yes, and we start with an audit of what currently ranks and converts so the redesign protects those assets. Redesigns that ignore existing performance data are the most common cause of post-launch traffic loss." },

  faqs: [
    { question: "Why choose WordPress over a website builder?", answer: "WordPress gives you full ownership of your content, unrestricted SEO control including schema and redirects, and no platform limits on page count or URL structure. Builders are faster to start on and much harder to scale a serious content programme on." },
    { question: "Which page builder do you use?", answer: "Where possible we build with the native block editor and custom patterns, which produces far lighter markup. If your team already relies on Elementor or Divi, we will work within it and optimise around its overhead." },
    { question: "How many plugins will my site have?", answer: "Usually under twelve. Every plugin is a maintenance and security liability, so each one has to earn its place. Anything that can be handled with a few lines of theme code is handled in the theme instead." },
    { question: "Can you make my existing WordPress site faster?", answer: "Yes. A typical speed engagement covers hosting and TTFB, image conversion, render-blocking scripts, caching configuration, plugin pruning and database cleanup. Most sites we audit have their largest win in images and unused plugins." },
    { question: "Do you use Yoast or Rank Math?", answer: "Either works; we usually configure Rank Math for its schema flexibility. What matters more is the configuration — canonical rules, indexation control, sitemaps and structured data — than which plugin badge sits in the admin bar." },
    { question: "Is WordPress secure?", answer: "It is when maintained. We harden the install, restrict admin access, enforce strong authentication, keep core and plugins updated, and set up automated offsite backups so a bad update is a ten-minute rollback rather than a crisis." },
    { question: "Can you migrate my site from Wix or Squarespace?", answer: "Yes. We rebuild the content in WordPress, preserve or improve the URL structure with a full 301 redirect map, and monitor Search Console for coverage errors through the first weeks after the switch." },
    { question: "Will I be able to add new pages myself?", answer: "Yes. We build reusable block patterns for your common page types, so adding a new service or location page is a matter of picking a pattern and filling in the content, with the SEO fields already wired up." },
    { question: "Do you build multilingual WordPress sites?", answer: "Yes, typically with a translation plugin plus correct hreflang implementation. For markets like the UAE or Europe we also review URL structure so each language version can rank independently." },
    { question: "What does WordPress development cost?", answer: "Business site builds start around $400 and most multi-service sites land between $800 and $2,000 depending on page count, custom templates and integrations. Speed optimisation as a standalone project starts at $200." },

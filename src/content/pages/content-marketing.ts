    { question: "Do you use AI to write the content?", answer: "We use AI for research, clustering and outlining, never for final prose. Every published sentence is human-written and edited, which is why our pages continue to perform through helpful-content updates that flattened bulk-generated sites." },
    { question: "How long should a blog post be?", answer: "Long enough to fully answer the question and no longer. In practice that is 1,200–1,800 words for a focused how-to and 2,500–3,500 for a pillar page. Padding hurts, because it dilutes the passages an answer engine would otherwise extract." },
    { question: "How often should we publish?", answer: "Four to eight substantial pieces a month builds topical authority at a sensible pace for most businesses. Consistency and internal linking within a cluster matter more than raw output volume." },
    { question: "Will content help me appear in ChatGPT answers?", answer: "It is the main lever. Language models cite sources that state facts plainly, structure them clearly and are corroborated elsewhere. Answer-first pages plus schema plus consistent brand facts across the web is what moves you into generated answers." },
    { question: "Do you write in industry-specific niches?", answer: "Yes — healthcare, SaaS, legal, real estate, education, manufacturing, travel and e-commerce among others. Technical or regulated niches get a subject-matter review round with your team before publication." },
    { question: "Who owns the content?", answer: "You do, fully and permanently, from the moment it is delivered. There are no licensing terms and nothing is reused for another client." },
    { question: "Can you refresh existing content?", answer: "Yes, and it is often the fastest win available. Rewriting existing pages answer-first, adding schema, updating statistics and consolidating cannibalising URLs frequently lifts traffic faster than publishing anything new." },
    { question: "How do you handle keyword research?", answer: "We map keywords by intent — informational, comparison, commercial and transactional — then assign each cluster to a page type so pages do not compete with each other. Paid search data, where available, tells us which terms actually convert." },
    { question: "What reporting do I get?", answer: "Monthly reporting covering published pieces, rankings and impressions per target query, conversions attributed to content, and AI-visibility checks showing whether assistants now mention or cite your brand for tracked prompts." },

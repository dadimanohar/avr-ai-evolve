    { question: "Is AI SEO different from traditional SEO?", answer: "It overlaps but is not identical. Traditional SEO competes for ranked links; AI SEO competes for inclusion inside a synthesised answer. Content format, entity consistency and structured data matter more, and success is measured in citations rather than positions." },
    { question: "Does AI SEO replace normal SEO?", answer: "No. Most assistants retrieve from live search results, so poor crawlability or weak authority still blocks you. AI SEO is a layer on top of technically sound, authoritative SEO." },
    { question: "How do you measure AI visibility?", answer: "We maintain a prompt set of real buyer questions and run it monthly across the major assistants, recording whether your brand is mentioned, cited with a link, described accurately, and how that compares to competitors." },
    { question: "How long does AI SEO take to show results?", answer: "Retrieval improvements from structured data and content reformatting can appear within 2–6 weeks. Entity and authority work — the part that makes models recommend you unprompted — typically takes three to six months." },
    { question: "Can you control what an AI says about my brand?", answer: "You cannot control it directly, but you can strongly influence it by publishing clear, consistent, well-structured facts about your business and getting those facts repeated on sources the models trust." },
    { question: "Should I block AI crawlers?", answer: "If you want AI visibility, no. Blocking GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot or Google-Extended removes you from those systems. We configure robots.txt deliberately so you allow the engines you want to appear in." },
    { question: "What is llms.txt?", answer: "llms.txt is a plain-text file at the root of a site that summarises what the site offers and links to key pages in a machine-friendly way. It is an emerging convention we implement as part of LLMO work." },
    { question: "Does AI SEO work for local businesses?", answer: "Yes. Prompts like 'best dentist near Dondaparthy' are answered from directories, reviews and structured data, so clean NAP, LocalBusiness schema and review content directly affect whether you are recommended." },
    { question: "How much does AI SEO cost?", answer: "AI SEO packages are priced alongside our SEO retainers and start from a baseline audit; most clients run AI SEO as an add-on layer to an existing SEO programme. See our AI SEO packages page for current tiers." },

    { question: "What is content chunking?", answer: "Retrieval systems split pages into passages, embed them and match them to queries. Chunking-friendly content uses clear headings and self-contained sections so each passage remains meaningful on its own." },
    { question: "Do I need llms.txt?", answer: "It is optional and still an emerging convention, but it is cheap to add and gives LLM consumers a clean summary of your site and its key URLs. We include it in every LLMO engagement." },
    { question: "Does JavaScript hurt LLM retrieval?", answer: "It can. Several AI crawlers do not execute JavaScript, so content that only appears after hydration is invisible to them. Server-side rendering solves this." },
    { question: "Which schema types matter most for LLMO?", answer: "Organization and WebSite for identity, Service for offerings, Article for editorial content, FAQPage for question-answer pairs, LocalBusiness for physical presence and BreadcrumbList for context." },
    { question: "Should PDFs be converted to HTML?", answer: "Usually yes. Key facts locked inside PDFs, images or embedded tools are far less reliably retrieved than the same information in HTML." },
    { question: "Can LLMO be done without changing site design?", answer: "In most cases yes. The work is largely in markup, rendering and content structure rather than visual design." },
    { question: "How do I know LLMO is working?", answer: "Retrieval tests improve first — assistants summarise your pages correctly when asked directly. Citation share in unprompted answers follows as content and authority work compounds." },
    { question: "Is LLMO a one-off project?", answer: "The foundation is a project; keeping it true is ongoing. Every new template, redesign or CMS change can break rendering or schema, so we re-verify each quarter." },
